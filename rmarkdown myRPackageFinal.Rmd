## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

load required library
```{r, "step 1" }
library(lorem)
library(wordcloud)

```
write code for function
```{r, "create function" }
#create the function 
count_vowels_and_visualize <- function(sentence) {
  vowels <- c("a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", "I", "O", "U")
  vowel_freq <- table(tolower(unlist(strsplit(sentence, ""))))
  vowel_freq <- vowel_freq[names(vowel_freq) %in% vowels]
  
  # Create a word cloud for the frequency of each vowel
  wordcloud(names(vowel_freq), freq = vowel_freq, colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
  
  # Calculate total number of vowels
  total_vowels <- sum(vowel_freq)
  
  # Return total number of vowels
  return(total_vowels)
}


```

```{r, "test function" }
#generate a random sentence
sentence <- as.character(ipsum(1))
sentence
#use the function created above to return wordcloud visualization and the total number of vowels. 
total_vowels <- count_vowels_and_visualize(sentence)
total_vowels
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
